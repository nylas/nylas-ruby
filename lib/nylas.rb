# BUGFIX
#   See https://github.com/sparklemotion/http-cookie/issues/27
#   and https://github.com/sparklemotion/http-cookie/issues/6
#
# CookieJar uses unsafe class caching for dynamically loading cookie jars.
# If two rest-client instances are instantiated at the same time (in threads), non-deterministic
# behaviour can occur whereby the Hash cookie jar isn't properly loaded and cached.
# Forcing an instantiation of the jar onload will force the CookieJar to load before the system has
# a chance to spawn any threads.
# Note that this should technically be fixed in rest-client itself, however that library appears to
# be stagnant so we're forced to fix it here.
# This object should get GC'd as it's not referenced by anything.
