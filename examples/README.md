## Running the Examples

Before running any example, make sure to:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export NYLAS_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export NYLAS_API_URI="https://api.us.nylas.com"  # Optional, defaults to this value
   ```

3. Some examples may require additional environment variables. Check the specific example's documentation or code for details.
